# JvObserve
OpenCV and Java tool for astro- and microphotography.

Requires
--------
  
  - OpenCV

It's easiest just to build this in IDEA for now, until I figure out how to get OpenCV working with Maven or Gradle.
You can also use IDEA to generate ant build.xml, as I may do if maven/gradle fails.

To run:

```$ java -jar -DJava.library.path={path to opencv libs} Observe.jar```
